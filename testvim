Hello World

Do you think that you would insert any line here? 

Seriously, what are you thinking? Did you thought that you could expand anytime like this? Or maybe, not?

How about trying to use vim to edit for once? Vim is a really good text editor I have ever seen in my life. It is simple yet convinient once you get use to it.

However, I wish I could get use to it like how I get use to Word, really. I wish I could write my whole school essay on Vim, no need to format, no need to do those scientific stuff, just focus on writing like this.

I wish one day that Vim could be use as a popular text editor, like notepad and Microsoft Word. Wait, we have LaTeX, don't we? I have use LaTeX for a long time yet my English skill is not enough for writing a good essay report. How about if I stop reading those manga and start my skill training like this?

It would be useful to do so. Can you listen to those firework outside? Yes, those firework actually cannot distract me now since I am so focused on my writing. Yes, I really feel the best after a year of studying. I finally found what I have missed. The writing spirit has came back to me.

Wonder if Vim actually support Unicode or Vietnamese, let's try.

Xin chào thế giới. Bạn đang sử dụng Vim phiên bản xx.xx Nhưng mà thế này, tại sao phiên bản x-unikey này lại kì thế, không biết có phải tại x-unikey hỗ trợ tiếng Việt trong Vim hay không? Ừ, phần gõ tiếng Việt hơi kì.

Maybe I should fine a substitution for this.
